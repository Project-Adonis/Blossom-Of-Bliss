# Immersive Worlds

This is a website that uses **AI generated panoramic images** to create immersive worlds where you can freely look around. 
You can choose from a variety of scenes : nature, city, space and fantasy. Each scene has a high-resolution image 
that covers 360 degrees of view, giving you the illusion of being in that world. 

*Tip: You can use your mouse or keyboard to navigate the scene (look around in the world).*
