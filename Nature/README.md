Project Adonis: Immersive Worlds
Project Adonis is a website that uses panoramic images to create immersive worlds where you can freely look around. 
You can choose from a variety of scenes, such as nature, city, space, fantasy. Each scene has a high-resolution image 
that covers 360 degrees of view, giving you the illusion of being in that world. 

You can use your mouse or keyboard to navigate the scene, zoom in and out, and switch to full-screen mode.
